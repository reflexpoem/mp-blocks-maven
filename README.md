**Notes for the reader**

This project creates blocks of ASCII text in various forms, ranging from grids of repeated ASCII text to differently aligned blocks. We have also implemented our own original AsciiBlock, which diagonally shifts rows of text one to the right. 

Code for TestNewBlock is heavily borrowed from the TestBlocks.java file (modified Grid tests for the large part).
